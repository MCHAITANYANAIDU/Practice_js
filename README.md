--------------------------------
variables->
variables are like containers which are used to store the data and manipulate the data 
   var mybox; ----variable declaration
 declared in 4 ways
 1.var
 2.let
 3.const
 4.let and const are block scoped and var is function scoped
 var mybox = 10;----variable initialization

 let is a block scoped and is prefearable for variable declaration
 const is also block scoped but its value cannot be re assigned once it assigned

 global variable--> outside any function have a global scope and can be accessed and modified from any part of the script

 local variable-->variables declared within a function have local scope and can be only accessible within in that function
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOISTING:
-->variables declarations are hoisted to the top of thier scope during the compilation phase,but thier assignments remains where they are...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA TYPES:
-->Primitive datatypes
-->non-primitive datatypes
-->Special datatype
PRIMITIVE DATA:
*fundamental building blocks used to represent single values
*directly stored in memory
*Immutable-cannot be changed after they are created
-->numbers,boolean,strings,undefined,null,symbol
*null:represents the intentional absence of any object value
*undefined:represents an uninitialized variable or an expression that has not been evaluated yet
*symbol:represents a unique and immutable primitive value


NON-PRIMITIVE DATATYPES:
*also know as reference type
*more complex data structures that can hold multiple values and have methods and properties
*Mutable:values can be changed after they are created
*stored and accessible by refernce rather they by value
*objects:
-->collection of key-value pairs
-->keys are strings and values can be any datatype
*arrays:
-->an ordered collection of elements accessed by index,starting from zero

SPECIAL DATATYPE:
*function: a block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of the script
*function is a first class citizen in javascript
*can be passed as an argument to another function
*can be returned from a function
*can be stored in a variable
*can be stored in an array
*can be stored in an object

OPERATORS:
-->Arithmetic operators
-->Comparison operators
-->Logical operators
-->Assignment operators
-->Bitwise operators
-->String operators


ARITHEMTIC OPERATORS:
-->addition: a + b
-->subtraction: a - b
-->multiplication: a * b
-->division: a / b
-->modulus: a % b
-->exponentiation: a ** b
-->increment: a++ or ++a
-->decrement: a-- or --a
-->unary plus: +a


ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
-->assignment: a = b
-->addition assignment: a += b
-->subtraction assignment: a -= b
-->multiplication assignment: a *= b
-->division assignment: a /= b
-->modulus assignment: a %= b
-->exponentiation assignment: a **= b
-->bitwise AND assignment: a &= b
-->bitwise OR assignment: a |= b
-->bitwise XOR assignment: a ^= b
-->bitwise NOT assignment: a ^= b


COMPARISION OPERATOR:
